# Memory Libraries

This project is designed to explore methods of loading libraries into memory rather
which could potentially help pack runtime data into executable units that we can
selectively load in as needed.

For this to work, the behavior must be able to boil down to the same routines that
would be used to handle this as if it came directly from disk. Fortunately, someone
already figured out the heavy lifting for us and we're here to test to see how it works.
